# canb-ML
Supervised classification of neonatal data

---
Given high-dimensional dataset with live births as labels, build supervised machine learning model to predict classes in unseen dataset.
* preprocess data into form amenable to supervised ML algorithms
* evaluate information and select features to best inform classifier
* benchmark classifiers on training set using cross-validation to determine best algorithm for future predictions

Before starting, set up Python environment:
```
pip install -r requirements.text
```
